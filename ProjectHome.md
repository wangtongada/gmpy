GMPY and GMPY2 are C-coded Python extension modules that support fast multiple-precision arithmetic.

GMPY only supports the GMP library and provides fast multiple-precision integer and rational arithmetic. The limited mpf type from GMP is also supported. GMPY is no longer being maintained.

GMPY2 supports the GMP library for integer and rational arithmetic but GMPY2 adds support for multiple-precision real and complex arithmetic as provided by the MPFR and MPC libraries. GMPY2 is being actively developed.
